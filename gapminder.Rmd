## Bringing in Rectangular data

First, we load the `gapminder` and `tidyverse` packages: 

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Part 1: Factor Management

### Drop Oceania
First, let's take a look at the dataset: 

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder))
```

So now, we know that we are dropping the 'Oceania' level from the 'continent' factor

Let's take a look what would happen when we drop Oceania:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == 'Oceania') %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Since we have 24 rows and 12 years for each country, we should have 24 entries less or 2 countries less after the modification, whatever one would prefer. 

We can also get more information about the dataset as follows: 

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  str()
```
### Actually dropping Oceania
```{r}
(gapminder_no_oceania = gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent != 'Oceania'))
```

I'm not going to put the tables with a large number of rows into `knitr::kable()` because then all the rows will be rendered. 

Let's check the modified factor: 

```{r}
gapminder_no_oceania$continent %>% 
  levels()
```
We still have Oceania! We need to call the `droplevels()` function to _actually_ drop Oceania. 

```{r}
(gapminder_no_oceania = gapminder_no_oceania %>% 
  droplevels())
```

```{r}
gapminder_no_oceania$continent %>% 
  levels()
```

Now, we see that Oceania is actually gone for good. 
 
Creating a smaller version of the dataset to read/write from the disk (dataset filtered down to data from 2002) and to reorder factors

```{r}
(gapminder_2002 = gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002))
```

```{r}
(gapminder_asia_2002 = gapminder_2002 %>% 
  filter(continent == 'Asia')) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

### Factor reordering
Now we will see what happens before we reorder the factors: 

```{r}
gapminder_asia_2002 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pop, country)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  xlab('log(pop)') + 
  ggtitle('log(Population) of Asian Countries, 2002')
```

It's pretty diffcult to get any sense of ordering on this graph. 

Now we will reorder the levels and re-make this plot: 

```{r}
gapminder_asia_2002 %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, pop, .fun=median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pop, country)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  xlab('log(pop)') + 
  ggtitle('log(Population) of Asian Countries, 2002')
```

This is clearly a much better graph as it also allows us to 
- view the extreme points much easily
- view the distribution much easily

### arrange
It seems that we should be able to do the same thing with `arrange()`. After all, we are only sorting the data before plotting. 

```{r}
gapminder_asia_2002 %>% 
  arrange(pop)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pop, country)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  ggtitle('log(Population) of Asian Countries, 2002')
```

This does not work because we are not changing the factors, which the plot is based off of. We are changing the rows in the table, but the categories are still plotted alphabetically.  

Using `fct_reorder`, on the other hand, actually relabels the categories according to the ranking of their population. Hence, the plot with `fct_reorder` is different because the first category corresponds to the country with highest population, instead of the first country that comes along alphabetically.  

## Part 2: File I/O
We will demonstrate file i/o with the `gapminder_2002` data frame. 

### write_csv()/read_csv()
```{r}
write_csv(gapminder_2002, 'gapminder_2002.csv')
```
confirm that the file exists:
```{r}
list.files(pattern = "gapminder_2002.csv")
```
We see that the file `gapminder_2002.csv` exists so we know that `write_csv` worked as intended

```{r}
read_data = read_csv('gapminder_2002.csv')
```

```{r}
read_data %>% str()
```

We don't see a factor anywhere. This indicates that the factors are not preserved after writing to a CSV file. We will see a better method to do this in the next section. 

### saveRDS()/readRDS()

```{r}
gapminder_2002 %>% saveRDS('gapminder_2002.rds')
```

Check to make sure that the file exists: 

```{r}
list.files(pattern = "gapminder_2002.rds")
```

As expected, the file exists. 

Now, read in the file again: 

```{r}
rds_file = readRDS('gapminder_2002.rds')
```
No errors! That's a good start, now let's check the dataset description: 

```{r}
rds_file %>% str()
```

As expected, we do not encounter any problems with reading in the `.rds` file. In particular, we note that country and continent are factors as expected. 

(Note that I filtered from the _original_ data frame, so we still have 142 countries and 5 continents)

## Part 3: Visualization Design

I am going to re-make a plot I handed in for assignment 2: 

**original:**

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(continent)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = 'dark green')
```

Let's see how we can improve this: 

- count on the y-axis is unclear. It seems that we are recording the number of countries, but it is not apparent from the axis
- we should give a title
- entries from different years are all mixed together. It is hard to imagine this being useful.
- could be more colourful although the current scheme is readable

Instead, I am going to do the following: 

- contrast the total population of the 5 continents
- express these values as percentages in order to make it easy to see which continents have increased and decreased their proportion of world population
- give the graph a meaningful title
- use colour to contrast the change or some other meaningful way
- separate the years 

First, let's calculate the sum of population for each continent/each year
```{r}
plot_data = gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent,year) %>% 
  summarize(totalPop = sum((as.double(pop)))) # we need this to prevent integer overflow 
```
We also need to get the world population for each point in time, which the following code block does: 

```{r}
plot_data = plot_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(popRatio = totalPop/sum(totalPop))
```

Finally, we generate a stacked-area graph, which allows us to accurately visualize the proportion of categories over time; in this case, it is the continents and how their population progresses as a proportion of the world population. 

```{r}
(improved_graph = plot_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, popRatio, fill=continent)) + 
  geom_area(position = 'stack') + 
  xlab('year') +
  ylab('Percentage of world population') +
  ggtitle('Proportion of world population in continents over time'))
```

We can see from this graph that Asia has the majority of the world's population, and Americas' hasn't changed must in the last 60 years or so. Africa's population has increased and Europe's has decreased. Oceania has always been rather un-populated. 

### Plotly

Load the library `plotly`: 

```{r}
library(plotly)
```

Convert the `ggplot` object into a `plotly` object: 

```{r}
improved_graph_plotly = improved_graph %>% ggplotly()
```

Let's take a look at the new file:

```{r}
# improved_graph_plotly
# commented out; because github doesn't support it. 
```

The most distinctive thing about the `plotly` graph is _interactivity_: I can hover my mouse over a data point and I can read it off. This seems to be better for people using `Rmd` but not necessarily for publishing graphs in papers because obviously such a feature is not possible on paper or `pdf`. 

Also, this is not checkable on github because it is rendered in `md`. 

## Part 4: Writing Figures to File

Saving the figure to a file: 

```{r}
ggsave('pop_prop_time.png', plot = improved_graph)
```
